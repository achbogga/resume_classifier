Business Analyst
Nationwide is one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world, focusing on domestic property and casualty insurance, life insurance and retirement savings, asset management, and strategic investments. The project I worked was the Claims replacement for Group disability. Currently all claims for the Group Disability insurance is handled manually on paper files. This project uses a third party software where claims are received by the customer electronically/over the phone rather than a paper claim form /letter. Currently, in order to process a Group disability claim data is accessed from the mainframe system, Admin System and other sources which is slow and time consuming. When the Nation Wide project is implemented, Group disability claims will be handled by one system, which would process data claims faster and also cut cost on staff wages.
