Programmer
Built-in-Self-Repair for Embedded RAMS
The aim of this project Built-In Self-Repair (BISR), with Selectable Redundancy is an effective yield-enhancement strategy for embedded memories.  BISR consists of a Programmable Memory Built-In Self-Test (PMBIST) module, a Built-In Address-Analysis (BIAA) module and a Multiplexer (MUX) module. Programmable Memory BIST is used to run variety of algorithms without the need of dedicated BIST hardware for each algorithm. It gives flexibility to accommodate new test algorithms developed for newly identified defects. In BIAA module, fault addresses and redundant ones form a one-to-one mapping to achieve a high repair speed.
Responsibilities:
· Design and Architect the block diagram based on the specifications given by the customer.

· Understanding the previous work related to the project.

· RTL coding and Test bench development in Verilog and verifying the results through simulation.

· Synthesis the code and Implement the design in SPARTAN 3E FPGA Evaluation board.

· Verify the results in SPARTAN 3E kit by adding chipscope pro into the design.
Environment: Xilinx ISE 10.1, Modelsim 6.0, SPARTAN 3E Kit.
