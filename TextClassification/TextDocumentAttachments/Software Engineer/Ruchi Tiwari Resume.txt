	Project

	Project Title
	Arcadian and Medicare Acquisition

	Period
	Oct -2012- to June-2012 

	Description
	 Humana Insurance, headquartered in Kentucky, is an American managed health care company that markets and administers health insurance.

In the Medicare Datamart flow that processes the MMR file, there is a lookup process to get the Humana key information and ledgers for the member to whom the MMR data belongs.  For the acquisitions, there could be adjustments coming through the MMR file that are for coverage dates prior to the acquisition/conversion to CI.  If nothing is done, these records end up defaulting to a ledger based on the contract/pbp that is a current ledger and therefore incorrect.  To correct this, the business partners are compiling a list of members that have been active with either acquisition in the past 39 months and the Humana keys and ledgers to go with them.  We need to look up the Humana keys and ledgers for any adjustments made on the acquisition contract/pbp’s that are for coverage periods prior to what is found on the current CI interface file.
