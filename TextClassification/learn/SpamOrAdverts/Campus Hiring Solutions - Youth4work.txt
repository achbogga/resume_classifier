•  Quest to acquire top fresh talent

   data, even after the end of academic session 

•  Reach restricted to only around 400-500 top 

   institutes 

•  Physically difﬁcult to map all 6000+ institutes

   on their requirements with pre-assessed talents 

   ranked for their skills and activeness
