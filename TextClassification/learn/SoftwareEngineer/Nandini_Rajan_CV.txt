	Team Member

	Responsibilities:
	As a Team Member  was responsible for the following activities:

	The Project
 :
	TEM (Telco Elasticity Management) was a Performance Monitoring project that collected Performance Measurements of Network Elements through a Telnet or REST call and processed that data to make decision. 

TEM had support to multiple network element.It interacted with the network elements and made a decision of either adding/powering on a VM to manage the high performance or decreasing a VM / powering off a VM incase of it not needed. The power off and on of VM where performed through a 2 way cloud call. 

TEM acts as an interface for an operator to interact between the network elements and cloud for Performance management by taking some decision inputs from the operator. It was also developed with an intelligence to analyse the history pattern and predict a decision.
